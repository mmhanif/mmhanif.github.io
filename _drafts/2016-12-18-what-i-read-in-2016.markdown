I've always been a pretty avid reader. Some time this year I came across an article suggesting you should read 50 books a year. (I can't remember the exact article, but googling 'read 50 books a year' brings up a lot of articles and blog posts, so it's clearly a popular concept.)

Although I love physical books, I switched to e-books some years ago. I typically read during my commute (~3 hrs a day) either on my Kindle or by listening to an audiobook. Ever since Amazon bought Audible a few years back they have been improving the integration between their e-books and audiobooks, so that if you own both, your reading position gets synched between them. They often have deals where you can get the audiobooks for a few dollars when you buy the e-book, so I have been doing that whenver I get the chance. 

I fell short of the target of 50 this, but here's what I did get through in 2016:
