*Audible*

**Publisher's Description:**
"Named a "must read" by Susan Cain, "endlessly fascinating" by Daniel Pink,
and "bursting with practical insights" by Adam Grant. A former rocket
scientist reveals the habits, ideas, and strategies that will empower you
to turn the seemingly impossible into the possible. Rocket science is often
celebrated as the ultimate triumph of technology. But it's not. Rather,
it's the apex of a certain thought process -- a way to imagine the
unimaginable and solve the unsolvable. It's the same thought process that
enabled Neil Armstrong to take his giant leap for mankind, that allows
spacecraft to travel millions of miles through outer space and land on a
precise spot, and that brings us closer to colonizing other planets.
Fortunately, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to think like one. In
this accessible and practical book, Ozan Varol reveals nine simple
strategies from rocket science that you can use to make your own giant
leaps in work and life -- whether it's landing your dream job, accelerating
your business, learning a new skill, or creating the next breakthrough
product. Today, thinking like a rocket scientist is a necessity. We all
encounter complex and unfamiliar problems in our lives. Those who can
tackle these problems -- without clear guidelines and with the clock
ticking -- enjoy an extraordinary advantage. Think Like a Rocket Scientist
will inspire you to take your own moonshot and enable you to achieve
liftoff."
