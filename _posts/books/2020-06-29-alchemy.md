**Alchemy** by Rory Sutherland

<sup>isbn-13: 9780062388414</sup>

*Audible*

**Publisher's Description:**
"The legendary advertising guru—Ogilvy UK’s vice chairman—and star of three
massively popular TED Talks, blends the science of human behavior with his
vast experience in the art of persuasion in this incomparable book that
decodes successful branding and marketing in the vein of Freakonomics,
Thinking Fast and Slow, and The Power of Habit. When Rory Sutherland was a
trainee working on a direct mail campaign at the famed advertising firm
OgilvyOne, he noticed that very small changes in design often had immense
effects on the number of consumer responses. Yet no one he worked with knew
why. Sutherland began taking stock of each effective yet nebulous
trick—”the thing which has no name”—he discovered. As he rose in the
advertising industry, he began to understand why these things had no name:
no one was interested in quantifying them, cataloguing them, or really
investigating them. So, he did it himself. Like classic behavioral
economists Daniel Kahneman and Richard Thaler, Sutherland peels away
hidden, often irrational human behaviors that explain how the world around
us functions. In How to Be an Alchemist he examines why certain ads work
and the broader truths they tell us about who we are. Why do people prefer
stripy toothpaste, and how might that help us design retirement plans that
young people would actually buy? Why do we think orange juice is healthy,
and how does the same principle guide our feelings about nuclear reactors?
Why do budget airlines advertise services they don’t offer—and what might
insurance companies learn from them about keeping healthcare costs low?
Filled with startling and profound conclusions, Sutherland’s journey
through the world of advertising and its surprising lessons for human
behavior is insightful, brilliant, eye-opening, and irresistibly fun."
