**Domain-Specific Knowledge Graph Construction** by Mayank Kejriwal

<sup>isbn-13: 9783030123741</sup>

*Paperback*

**Publisher's Description:**
"The vast amounts of ontologically unstructured information on the Web,
including HTML, XML and JSON documents, natural language documents, tweets,
blogs, markups, and even structured documents like CSV tables, all contain
useful knowledge that can present a tremendous advantage to the Artificial
Intelligence community if extracted robustly, efficiently and semi-
automatically as knowledge graphs. Domain-specific Knowledge Graph
Construction (KGC) is an active research area that has recently witnessed
impressive advances due to machine learning techniques like deep neural
networks and word embeddings. This book will synthesize Knowledge Graph
Construction over Web Data in an engaging and accessible manner. The book
will describe a timely topic for both early -and mid-career researchers.
Every year, more papers continue to be published on knowledge graph
construction, especially for difficult Web domains. This work would serve
as a useful reference, as well as an accessible but rigorous overview of
this body of work. The book will present interdisciplinary connections when
possible to engage researchers looking for new ideas or synergies. This
will allow the book to be marketed in multiple venues and conferences. The
book will also appeal to practitioners in industry and data scientists
since it will have chapters on both data collection, as well as a chapter
on querying and off-the-shelf implementations. The author has, and
continues to, present on this topic at large and important conferences. He
plans to make the powerpoint he presents available as a supplement to the
work. This will draw a natural audience for the book. Some of the reviewers
are unsure about his position in the community but that seems to be more a
function of his age rather than his relative expertise. I agree with some
of the reviewers that the title is a little complicated. I would recommend
“Domain Specific Knowledge Graphs”."
