**The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World** by Pedro Domingos

*Kindle*

A tour through the five tribes of machine learning, each with their own master algorithm:

| Tribe          | Representation   | Evaluation            | Optimization             |
|----------------|------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Symbolists     | Logic            | Accuracy              | Inverse Deduction        |
| Connectionists | Neural Networks  | Squared Error         | Gradient Descent         |
| Evolutionaries | Genetic Programs | Fitness               | Genetic Search           |
| Bayesians      | Graphical Models | Posterior Probability | Probabilistic Inference  |
| Analogizers    | Support Vectors  | Margin                | Constrained Optimization |

The goal of this tour is ultimately to introduce the quest for a single *Master Algorithm* or *unified learner* that combines the best parts of all these approaches. Domingos proposed solution is a unified learner that uses a Markov Logic Network (MLN) as the representation, posterior probability as the evaluation function and genetic search coupled with gradient descent as the optimizer. An implementation called [Alchemy](https://alchemy.cs.washington.edu) is downloadable to play with.

The book is an interesting overview of the different approaches to machine learning, but only gives a taste of each, without getting in to any mathematical detail. For someone new to machine learning, they will require to put in a reasonable amount of effort to read this book, whereas for those who understand one or two of the approaches they may feel unsatisfied with the high-level overview of each approach.
