**The Art Of Statistics** by David Spiegelhalter

<sup>isbn-13: 9781541618510</sup>

*Hardcover*

**Publisher's Description:**
"The definitive guide to statistical thinking Statistics are everywhere, as
integral to science as they are to business, and in the popular media
hundreds of times a day. In this age of big data, a basic grasp of
statistical literacy is more important than ever if we want to separate the
fact from the fiction, the ostentatious embellishments from the raw
evidence -- and even more so if we hope to participate in the future,
rather than being simple bystanders. In The Art of Statistics, world-
renowned statistician David Spiegelhalter shows readers how to derive
knowledge from raw data by focusing on the concepts and connections behind
the math. Drawing on real world examples to introduce complex issues, he
shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the
Titanic, whether a notorious serial killer could have been caught earlier,
and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. The Art of Statistics
not only shows us how mathematicians have used statistical science to solve
these problems -- it teaches us how we too can think like statisticians. We
learn how to clarify our questions, assumptions, and expectations when
approaching a problem, and -- perhaps even more importantly -- we learn how
to responsibly interpret the answers we receive. Combining the incomparable
insight of an expert with the playful enthusiasm of an aficionado, The Art
of Statistics is the definitive guide to stats that every modern person
needs."
