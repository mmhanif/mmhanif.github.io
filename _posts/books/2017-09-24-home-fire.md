**Home Fire** by Kamila Shamsie

*Kindle and Audible Unabridged, narrated by Tania Rodrigues*

This was one of my favorite books of the year and first Kamila Shamsie novel I've read. A modern reworking of the greek tragedy Sophocles (not that I'd read that before coming to this book), at first I was a little bit apprehensive, wondering if this was going to be like a Jonathan Frantzen novel full of unsympathetic characters. I was gradually drawn in by the characters and I found they change of narrator through the book to be very effective at unfolding th plot line from different perspectives. It was a profoundly sad ending and even as I write this I am experiencing a sense of loss over the characters in this wonderful novel.
