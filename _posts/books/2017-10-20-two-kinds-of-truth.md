**Two Kinds of Truth** by Michael Connelly

*Audible Unabridged, narrated by Titus Welliver*

I pretty much consume everything Michael Connelly produces shortly after its release and this book was no exception. This latest Harry Bosch novel keeps up the high standard of all the books in the series. You can see the end coming though given that Harry is now getting on in years. Intrigued to see how Connelly will eventually finish off the series, but I'm in no rush for that to happen!
