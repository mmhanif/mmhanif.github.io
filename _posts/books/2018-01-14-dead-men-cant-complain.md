**Dead Men Can't Complain and Other Stories** by Peter Clines

*Audible*

A quick (~5hrs) but enjoyable listen. This collection of short stories from Peter Clines worked great as an interlude in between longer listens. Super-heroes, zombies, aliens - what's not to like?! Reminiscent of stories from the British tv series "Tales of the Unexpected", the stories often have a sting in the tail that leaves you to fill in the details.
