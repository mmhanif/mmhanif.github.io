I had previously read a couple of Peter Clines novels ("14" and "The Fold") and really enjoyed them. They had a slightly *steampunk* feel to them and were clever and creepy at the same time. When I found out he had written a series of novels that were a mashup of DC and Marvel-style super-heroes with the zombie-apocalypse, I was intrigued. 

Overall the series was great fun to read - not high art, but well-written. The scenario presented was, I thought, well thought-through so that you didn't spend all your time picking holes in the story. The writing has surprising (for a super-hero/zombie novel) depth at times - for example this exchange from "Ex-Isle":

> I stood straight and turned to him. "Twenty-two days ago, on the roof of Hollywood and Highland, you told me you wished to be a symbol of hope. This is the challenge of hope versus fear, George. Fear is a simple, base emotion felt by every mammal, one that requires no rational though, no logic. It is an easy thing to rule by fear."

> He looked up. "I don't want us to be ruling by--"

> "It is also", I continued, "an easy thing to be ruled by it. Making decisions based on fear requires no effort. In challenging times, many people prefer such a path. It is easier to be scared of a situation than to make the effort to understand it. Fear provides an excuse to avoid responsibility. Even before the ex-virus, there were many people throughout history who took advantage of this tendency."
