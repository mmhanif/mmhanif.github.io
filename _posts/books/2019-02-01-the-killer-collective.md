**The Killer Collective** by Barry Eisler

"A fast-paced, page-turning novel of betrayal, vengeance, and depraved
secrets in high places from the New York Times bestselling author of the
John Rain and Livia Lone series. When a joint FBI-Seattle Police
investigation of an international child pornography ring gets too close to
certain powerful people, sex-crimes detective Livia Lone becomes the target
of a hit that barely goes awry--a hit that had been offered to John Rain, a
retired specialist in killings appearing to be from "natural causes."
Suspecting that the FBI themselves were behind the attack, Livia reaches
out to former marine sniper Dox. Together, they assemble an ad hoc team to
identify and neutralize the threat: Rain; Rain's estranged lover, Mossad
agent and honey-trap specialist Delilah; black op soldiers Ben Treven and
Daniel Larison; and their former commander, SpecOps legend Colonel Scott
"Hort" Horton. Moving from Japan to Seattle to DC to Paris, the group
fights a series of interlocking conspiracies, each edging closer and closer
to the highest levels of the US government. With uncertain loyalties,
conflicting agendas, and smoldering romantic entanglements, this group is
hardly a team. But in a match as uneven as this one, a collective of
killers might be just what they need."
