**Letters of Note: An Eclectic Collection of Correspondence Deserving of a Wider Audience** by Shaun Usher

*Kindle*

An enjoyable book to read through, an interesting variety of letters. It does seem that letter-writing is a dying art nowadays - it's been at least two decades, I think, since I last put pen to paper to write a letter. If nothing else, this book is a nudge to try pick up that pen again and write.
