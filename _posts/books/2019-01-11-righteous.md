**Righteous** by Joe Ide

*Audible*

The second installment in the IQ (Isaiah Quintabe) series. Isaiah seemed a bit more vulnerable in this second novel, less sure in his detective powers and more susceptible to emotional overrides. The novel also introduced a character who I'm hoping will be the Professor Moriarity to Isaiah's Sherlock. This second book in the series does not disappoint.
