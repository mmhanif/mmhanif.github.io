**The Coming Storm** by Michael Lewis

*Audible*

"The Coming Storm" is available exclusively as an audiobook on Audible and is a short (2.5 hr) but engaging listen about the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOIAA) which oversees the NWS. In typical Michael Lewis fashion the story is driven through focusing on specific characters within the NWS and NOIAA who have helped build those organizations through to a portrait of the current Trump-nominee to run the NOIAA, Barry Myers, who thinks that the government should get out of the "business" of weather forecasting. Troubling indeed.
