**Holding** by Graham Norton

<sup>isbn-13: 9781501173264</sup>

*Audible*

"From Graham Norton, the BAFTA-award-winning Irish television host and
author of the “sparkling and impish” (Daily Mail) memoirs The Life and
Loves of a He Devil and So Me, comes a charming debut novel set in an
idyllic Irish village where a bumbling investigator has to sort through
decades of gossip and secrets to solve a mysterious crime. The remote Irish
village of Duneen has known little drama but when human remains are
discovered on an old farm, suspected to be that of Tommy Burke—a former
lover of two different inhabitants—the village’s dark past begins to
unravel. As the frustrated sergeant PJ Collins struggles to solve a genuine
case for the first time in his life, he unearths a community’s worth of
anger and resentments, secrets and regret. In this darkly comic, touching,
and at times heartbreaking novel, perfect for fans of J.K. Rowling’s The
Casual Vacancy, Graham Norton employs his acerbic wit to breathe life into
a host of loveable characters, and explore—with searing honesty—the
complexities and contradictions that make us human."
