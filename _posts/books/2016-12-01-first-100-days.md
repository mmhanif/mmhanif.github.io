- **The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan: How to Take Charge, Build or Merge Your Team, and Get Immediate Results** by George Bradt, Jayme Check, Jogn Lawler
- **Your First 100 Days in a New Executive Job** by Robert Hargrove

Earlier this year, I moved from one part of the company I worked in to another. I wanted to understand how to make sure I hit the ground running in the new role, so I bought *The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan* to see if I could get some tips. When buying the book, I noticed that *Your First 100 Days in a New Executive Job* was available for free as part of the *Kindle Unlimited* program which I am a member of, so I got that too. 

When I want to learn about a topic, I often find myself getting two or three books on it. I find (or am afraid) that a single book will only provide a one-dimensional view and I like gettting second and third opinions.

The *The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan* feels the more comprehensive of the two books. It's organized into four parts:
1. Become the Best Candidate for the Job
2. Discover Your New Role
3. Take Control of Your Own Start
4. Implement Your 100-Day Action Plan

As mine was an internal move, parts 2 and 3 were more relevant for me. Overall, I found a number of useful ideas - for someone coming in at a very senior executive level, I'm sure the concepts laid out in the book would be extremely relevant. For someone like me at a slightly less elevated level, there's more constraints on how many of the ideas you can usefully implement.

*Your First 100 Days in a New Executive Job* has a reasonably similar approach to *The New Leader's 100-Day Action Plan*. It has more stories and anecdotes than the latter
