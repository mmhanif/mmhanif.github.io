**The dispatcher** by John Scalzi

<sup>isbn-13: 9781596067868</sup>

*Audible*

"One day, not long from now, it becomes almost impossible to murder anyone -
999 times out of a thousand, anyone who is intentionally killed comes back.
How? We don't know. But it changes everything: war, crime, daily life. Tony
Valdez is a Dispatcher - a licensed, bonded professional whose job is to
humanely dispatch those whose circumstances put them in death's crosshairs,
so they can have a second chance to avoid the reaper. But when a fellow
Dispatcher and former friend is apparently kidnapped, Tony learns that
there are some things that are worse than death, and that some people are
ready to do almost anything to avenge what they see as a wrong. It's a race
against time for Valdez to find his friend before it's too late...before
not even a Dispatcher can save him."
