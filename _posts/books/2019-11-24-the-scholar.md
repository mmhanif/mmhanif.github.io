"From the author of The Ruin comes a compulsive new crime thriller set in
the fiercely competitive, cutthroat world of research and academia, where
the brightest minds will stop at nothing to succeed. When Dr. Emma Sweeney
stumbles across the victim of a hit-and-run outside Galway University early
one morning, she calls her boyfriend, Detective Cormac Reilly, bringing him
first to the scene of a murder that would otherwise never have been
assigned to him. The dead girl is carrying an ID that will put this crime
at the center of a scandal--her card identifies her as Carline Darcy, heir
apparent to Darcy Therapeutics, Ireland's most successful pharmaceutical
company. Darcy Therapeutics has a finger in every pie, from sponsoring
university research facilities to funding political parties to philanthropy
--it has even funded Emma's own ground-breaking research. As the murder
investigation twists in unexpected ways and Cormac's running of the case
comes under scrutiny from the department and his colleagues, he is forced
to question himself and the beliefs that he has long held as truths. Who
really is Emma? And who is Carline Darcy? A gripping and atmospheric
follow-up to The Ruin, an "expertly plotted, complex web of secrets that
refuse to stay hidden" (Karen Dionne, author of The Marsh King's Daughter),
The Scholar is perfect for fans of Tana French and Flynn Berry."
