**Publisher's Description:**
"Lost Hills is Lee Goldberg at his best. Inspired by the real-world grit
and glitz of LA County crime, this book takes no prisoners. And neither
does Eve Ronin. Take a ride with her and you'll find yourself with a
heroine for the ages. And you'll be left hoping for more." --Michael
Connelly, #1 New York Times bestselling author "Thrills and chills! Lost
Hills is the perfect combination of action and suspense, not to mention Eve
Ronin is one of the best new female characters in ages. You will race
through the pages!" --Lisa Gardner, #1 New York Times bestselling author A
video of Deputy Eve Ronin's off-duty arrest of an abusive movie star goes
viral, turning her into a popular hero at a time when the Los Angeles
County Sheriff's Department is plagued by scandal. The sheriff, desperate
for more positive press, makes Eve the youngest female homicide detective
in the department's history. Now Eve, with a lot to learn and resented by
her colleagues, has to justify her new badge. Her chance comes when she and
her burned-out, soon-to-retire partner are called to the blood-splattered
home of a missing single mother and her two kids. The horrific carnage
screams multiple murder--but there are no corpses. Eve has to rely on her
instincts and tenacity to find the bodies and capture the vicious killer,
all while battling her own insecurities and mounting pressure from the
media, her bosses, and the bereaved family. It's a deadly ordeal that will
either prove her skills...or totally destroy her."
