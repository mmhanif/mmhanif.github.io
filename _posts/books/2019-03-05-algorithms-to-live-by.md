"A fascinating exploration of how insights from computer algorithms can be
applied to our everyday lives, helping to solve common decision-making
problems and illuminate the workings of the human mind All our lives are
constrained by limited space and time, limits that give rise to a
particular set of problems. What should we do, or leave undone, in a day or
a lifetime? How much messiness should we accept? What balance of new
activities and familiar favorites is the most fulfilling? These may seem
like uniquely human quandaries, but they are not: computers, too, face the
same constraints, so computer scientists have been grappling with their
version of such issues for decades. And the solutions they've found have
much to teach us. In a dazzlingly interdisciplinary work, acclaimed author
Brian Christian and cognitive scientist Tom Griffiths show how the
algorithms used by computers can also untangle very human questions. They
explain how to have better hunches and when to leave things to chance, how
to deal with overwhelming choices and how best to connect with others. From
finding a spouse to finding a parking spot, from organizing one's inbox to
understanding the workings of memory, Algorithms to Live By transforms the
wisdom of computer science into strategies for human living."
