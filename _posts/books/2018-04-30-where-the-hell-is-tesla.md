**Where the Hell is Tesla?: A Novel** by Rob Dircks

*Audible*

I have a thing for the time-travel sub-genre of science fiction and the fact that this novel had Nicola Tesla as a character made it initially appealing. The two main characters turned out to be "bros" and I found their dialog to be somewhat irritating. Forgettable.
