**The Driver** by Hart Hanson

*Audible*

This was recommended by Michael Connelly, one of my favorite authors, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Hart Hanson is apparently the creator of the TV series *Bones* which I have never watched. This book was engaging from the beginning, a tough modern-day crime story with heart and depth - a bit like the main character. 

I listened to the audiobook and the narrator, Ari Fliakos, gave an excellent performance.
