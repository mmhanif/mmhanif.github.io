**Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations** by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and Gene Kim

*Kindle*

I was definitely looking forward to reading this as one of the authors, Gene Kim, also co-authored one of my favorite books related to software development, "The Phoenix Project". This book is a little drier than the Phoenix Project ... actually a lot drier. It's an assesment of what software development practices are the biggest indicators of success based on rigorous research.

Their research uncovered 24 key capabilities that drive software delivery performance, classified into five categories:

**CONTINUOUS DELIVERY CAPABILITIES**
1. Version Control
2. Deployment Automation
3. Continuous Integration
4. Trunk-based Development
5. Test Automation
6. Test Data Management
7. Shift-left on Security
8. Continuous Deployment

**ARCHITECTURE CAPABILITIES**
9. Loosely-coupled Architecture
10. Empowered Teams

**PRODUCT AND PROCESS CAPABILITIES**
11. Customer Feedback
12. Value Stream
13. Working in Small Batches
14. Team Experimentation

**LEAN MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING CAPABILITIES**
15. Lightweight Change Approval Processes
16. Monitoring
17. Proactive Notification
18. WIP Limits
19. Visualizing Work

**CULTURAL CAPABILITIES**
20. Westrum Organizational Culture
21. Support Learning
22. Collaboration Among Teams
23. Job Satisfaction
24. Transformational Leadership
